    <h2 class="text-center">About Stars</h2>
    <p>
      Stars are among the most fascinating and fundamental objects in the universe. They are massive, luminous spheres
      of hot plasma, held together by their own gravity. At their cores, stars generate enormous amounts of energy
      through the process of nuclear fusion, where hydrogen atoms fuse to form helium. This reaction releases light and
      heat, which is why stars shine so brilliantly in the night sky. Without stars, galaxies would not exist, and life
      as we know it on Earth would be impossible, since our Sun provides both warmth and energy for all living things.
    </p>
    <p>
      The formation of a star begins inside large clouds of gas and dust, called nebulae. Over time, gravity pulls the
      particles within these clouds closer together, causing the material to heat up and eventually ignite nuclear
      fusion. This marks the birth of a new star. Depending on its initial mass, a star can have a very different journey
      throughout its lifetime.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, blue stars are the hottest, while red stars are cooler. Stars also come in various sizes, from small
      red dwarfs that burn slowly for billions of years to massive blue giants that live short but intense lives. The
      life cycle of a star is a captivating story of change and transformation. A star like our Sun will eventually expand
      into a red giant before shedding its outer layers and leaving behind a dense white dwarf. More massive stars,
      however, end their lives in dramatic explosions called supernovae, scattering heavy elements across space.
    </p>
    <p>
      These explosions often leave behind neutron stars or even black holes, some of the most mysterious objects in the
      cosmos. The study of stars is central to the field of astronomy. By observing their light, scientists can learn
      about their composition, temperature, distance, and age. Stars also help us understand the origins of the universe,
      since the elements necessary for life — such as carbon, oxygen, and iron — were forged in the hearts of ancient
      stars and spread across the cosmos when those stars died.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, stars are not just points of light in the night sky. They are cosmic furnaces, creators of elements, and
      markers of time. From guiding early navigators on Earth to inspiring myths, science, and exploration, stars continue
      to shape our understanding of the universe and our place within it.

  <!-- Explore Section -->
  <section id="explore" class="container mt-5 mb-5">
    <h2 class="text-center">Explore the Universe</h2>
    <p>
      The universe is vast, mysterious, and filled with wonders that stretch far beyond our imagination. When we look up
      at the night sky, we see countless stars, planets, and galaxies — but this is only a tiny fraction of the cosmos.
      Exploring the universe allows us to uncover its secrets, from how stars are born to how entire galaxies evolve over
      billions of years.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the heart of our universe are stars, the glowing beacons of light that illuminate space. They gather together in
      galaxies, massive collections of billions or even trillions of stars, gas, and dark matter. Our own galaxy, the
      Milky Way, is home to more than 100 billion stars, including our Sun. And beyond it, there are billions of other
      galaxies, each unique in size, shape, and composition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exploration doesn’t just happen with telescopes on Earth. Powerful space observatories, like the Hubble Space
      Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope, have given us breathtaking images of distant galaxies, nebulae, and
      exoplanets. These missions allow humanity to look deeper into space and further back in time, since light from
      faraway objects takes millions or even billions of years to reach us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exploring the universe is more than just science — it’s a journey of wonder and discovery. It shows us how connected
      everything is: the atoms in our bodies were once formed inside stars, and the forces that shape galaxies also
      influence our own world. By studying the universe, we not only learn where we come from but also expand our vision
      of what might be possible in the future.
